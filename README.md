====================

Names are stored in /awesomestate/<name>.awesome. Inside that file is a number from 1-100 which determines if you're awesome, sorta or not.
0-33 not awesome, 34-66 sorta awesome, 67-100 awesome.

You can login to the admin CP by navigating to /awesomestate/ and login there. The login database is set in /awesomestate/config.php.
You'll have to create your own users in the database table.

Use 3 columns "id, username & password" id is a primary key thing.
